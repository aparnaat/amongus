# AmongUs
Among Us themed virtual box

"AmongUs" is an interactive cybersecurity project that transforms the traditional penetration testing experience into an engaging Among Us-themed adventure. Built on the Ubuntu operating system, the project places participants in the shoes of the imposter, tasked with navigating a virtual box filled with security challenges and hidden flags. The environment is crafted to mimic the iconic tasks from the popular game "Among Us," creating an immersive and entertaining cybersecurity challenge.

Participants will leverage their hacking skills to complete tasks. These tasks vary in complexity, ranging from basic system reconnaissance to advanced exploitation techniques. The ultimate goal is to uncover hidden flags strategically placed throughout the system. Each completed challenge reveals a piece of vital information or a hidden flag, contributing to the imposter's overall objective. The project aims to simulate a realistic and engaging experience, combining the thrill of being an imposter with the educational aspects of cybersecurity.

"AmongUs" aims to provide an educational and entertaining approach to cybersecurity training, merging the thrill of the popular game "Among Us" with the real-world skills required to secure systems. The integration of an Among Us-themed narrative adds a layer of fun and excitement to the traditionally serious domain of cybersecurity, making it an ideal learning platform for enthusiasts, students, and professionals alike.
